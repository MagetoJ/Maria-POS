# Frontend API Configuration Fix

## Problem Identified

The frontend was making relative API calls (`/api/login`) instead of calling the correct backend server URL (`https://pos.mariahavens.com/api/login`) in production.

### Root Cause
- `VITE_API_URL` environment variable was not being properly set during the build process on Render
- The API configuration was falling back to relative paths or empty strings
- This caused 401 errors because the frontend couldn't reach the backend server

## Solution Applied

### 1. Enhanced API Configuration (`src/react-app/config/api.ts`)
- Added better debugging logs to show hostname and environment variables
- Improved fallback logic for production environments
- Ensured the backend URL is always used when needed

### 2. Updated Render Configuration (`render.yaml`)
- Added `VITE_API_URL` environment variable with the correct backend URL
- This ensures the environment variable is available during build time

### 3. Created Build Scripts
- **`build-for-render.js`**: Specialized build script for Render deployment
- **`package.json`**: Added `render-build` and `build:render` commands
- These scripts explicitly set environment variables before building

### 4. Testing and Verification
- **`test-api-config.js`**: Script to test API URL resolution logic
- Verifies the frontend will use the correct backend URL in different scenarios

## Changes Made

### Files Modified:
1. `src/react-app/config/api.ts` - Enhanced API URL resolution
2. `render.yaml` - Added VITE_API_URL environment variable
3. `package.json` - Added render-specific build scripts
4. `.env.production` - Already had correct backend URL

### Files Created:
1. `build-for-render.js` - Custom build script for Render
2. `test-api-config.js` - Testing script for API configuration
3. `FRONTEND_API_FIX.md` - This documentation

## Deployment Instructions

### Option 1: Update Render Environment Variables (Recommended)
1. Go to your Render dashboard
2. Navigate to your service (maria-havens-pos)
3. Go to Environment settings
4. Add environment variable:
   - **Key**: `VITE_API_URL`
   - **Value**: `https://pos.mariahavens.com`
5. Redeploy the service

### Option 2: Use Custom Build Command
1. Update the build command in Render dashboard to:
   ```
   npm install && npm run render-build && cd server && npm run setup-production-db
   ```
2. This will use the custom build script that sets environment variables

## Verification

After deployment, check the browser console for:
```
ðŸ”Œ API Configuration: {
  mode: "production",
  apiUrl: "https://pos.mariahavens.com",
  finalApiUrl: "https://pos.mariahavens.com",
  ...
}
```

The `finalApiUrl` should show the full backend URL, not be empty or relative.

## Expected Results

âœ… **Before Fix:**
- Console shows: `ðŸ”Œ Attempting login to: /api/login`
- Gets 401 error because it's calling the wrong endpoint
- API Configuration shows empty or relative URL

âœ… **After Fix:**
- Console shows: `ðŸ”Œ Attempting login to: https://pos.mariahavens.com/api/login`
- Successfully connects to backend server
- API Configuration shows the full backend URL

## Testing Locally

Run the API configuration test:
```bash
node test-api-config.js
```

This will show how the API URL is resolved in different scenarios.
